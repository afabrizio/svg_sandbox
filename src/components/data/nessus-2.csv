occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

This may allow a remote attacker to determine which domains have

have been recently visited. 

For instance, if an attacker was interested in whether your company
utilizes the online services of a particular financial institution,
they would be able to use this attack to build a statistical model
regarding company usage of that financial institution.  Of course, the
attack can also be used to find B2B partners, web-surfing patterns,
external mail servers, and more.

Note: If this is an internal DNS server not accessible to outside
networks, attacks would be limited to the internal network. This
may include employees, consultants and potentially users on

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

"20007","","5.0","Medium","192.168.16.13","tcp","62700","SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection","The remote service encrypts traffic using a protocol with known
weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html

Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC 
cipher suite, indicating that this server is vulnerable.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be

    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the

    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be

weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html

Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC 
cipher suite, indicating that this server is vulnerable.

It appears that TLSv1 or newer is supported on the server. However, the 
Fallback SCSV mechanism is not supported, allowing connections to be ""rolled 
back"" to SSLv3.

weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.
